# Gladius Wiki
Welcome to the Gladius Network Wiki! Here you will find installation guides, pull request guidelines/conduct, and general project information.

## Project Overview
Gladiusâ€™ goal is to create a fully decentralized, peer to peer, serverless
node network to connect bandwidth and storage pools to websites
looking for DDoS protection and expedited content delivery. Anyone
with a computer can download and run the Gladius edge node client in the
background to rent out their unused bandwidth, compute, and storage space
and earn Gladius Tokens (GLA). Large pools with hundreds, if not
thousands, of nodes will then be able to handle a continuous stream
of requests to validate website connections and block malicious
activity. Gladius operates in a similar way to existing platforms, but we
utilize compute assets that already exist instead of building new ones.
